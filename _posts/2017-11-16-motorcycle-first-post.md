Hi

I have been riding a Yamaha ybr125 for about 1.5 years now, and before that, a honda AG200 for about a year during my stint with the Singapore Army. Due to the licensing structure of Singapore roads, I cannot upgrade to a bigger cc bike until I get a better license, but that won't happen for now. 

Anyway, I do many of the basic maintenances of my YBR by myself, such as oil change, and chain adjustment and lubrication. I might decide to post a couple of my adventures here in this section in the near future. Near the top of the list is to change the front spocket from 14T to 15T, to experiment if the tradeoff of speed/power is worth it. The parts are here, but the time is not.
